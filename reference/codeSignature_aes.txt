# This file define the following signature(s):
#	- aes_t4 		: one round of the AES encryption/decryption (round 1 to 9), four tables version
#	- aes_t1 		: one round of the AES encryption/decryption (round 1 to 9), one table version (Remark: to be complete four version should be required since which of the for table is actually used)
