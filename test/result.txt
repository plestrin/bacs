List of results (at least one problem per test case is reported):

TEST_TEA_O0: 	ok
TEST_TEA_O1: 	~ 			the 0x0000000000000000 can be formed with multiple input combination
TEST_TEA_O2: 	~ 			the 0x0000000000000000 can be formed with multiple input combination
TEST_TEA_O3: 	~ 			the 0x0000000000000000 can be formed with multiple input combination
TEST_TEA_Os: 	fail 		the key buffer is read in a first loop and written on the stack in a more convenient way (reverse order)
TEST_TEA_WD: 	fail 		state vector (2 x 32 bits) is fragmented in the stack (24 bits gap)
TEST_TEA_WR: 	fail 		(large operand size 8) state vector is reversed and fragmented (1 access with MOV - 3 access with ADD)
TEST_AES_O0: 	ok
TEST_AES_O1: 	ok
TEST_AES_O2: 	ok
TEST_AES_O3: 	ok
TEST_AES_Os: 	ok
TOM_AES: 		fail 		(128 bits) - The state vector part that resides on the stack is concat with an other operand (pointer) - Solved by instruction sequence characterization
PP_AES128: 		fail  		(large operand size 16) - DEC - state in 2 mem and 2 regs - Solved by instruction sequence characterization
PP_AES192: 		fail 		(large operand size 16) - DEC - state in 2 mem and 2 regs - Solved by instruction sequence characterization
